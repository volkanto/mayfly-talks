== Dockerize your user stories

=== Problems we had @ bol.com

* Central, shared test environment
* Multiple teams in single codebase
* Unstable `master`

Development process unsuited to continuous delivery

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* What's the problem that Mayfly solves?
** Central test environment
** Multiple teams in single codebase
** Unstable `master`: lots of poorly coordinated changes, merge conflicts
Developer velocity severely impacted by dev setup, unable to cope with dev org growth

=== The solution: Mayfly

*user story*-centric +
continuous delivery +
*development* platform +

== Current state

* Early development
* Scope limited to simple services
* Usage
** 5 Mayfly services +
   (eating our own dogfood)
** 12 services of other teams



== Future

* DB support; Oracle, MongoDB, ...
* Add more services
* Working towards production ready
