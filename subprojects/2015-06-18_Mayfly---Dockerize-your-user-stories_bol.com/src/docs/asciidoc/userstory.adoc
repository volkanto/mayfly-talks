|I |Independent |The user story should be self-contained, in a way that there is no inherent dependency on another user story.
|N |Negotiable  |User stories, up until they are part of an iteration, can always be changed and rewritten.
|V |Valuable    |A user story must deliver value to the end user.
|E |Estimable   |You must always be able to estimate the size of a user story.
|S |Small       |User stories should not be so big as to become impossible to plan/task/prioritize with a certain level of certainty.
|T |Testable    |The user story or its related description must provide the necessary information to make test development possible

- can have its own continuous integration
- can be accepted independently
- and when it's done, it should be ready for production +
  or better yet, on production
