= `master` == production

Your users can enjoy the new features!

We strongly believe that +
for Continuous Delivery to work +
`master` should be equal to production.

An integration environment does not fit in
the Continuous Delivery flow.

But Mayfly doesn't really care about production, +
as long as the `master` branch is not changed
outside Mayfly.

== No integration environment?!

* Accept that, if you want CD, certain things can only be tested in production
* Mayfly uses mocks and stubbing to achieve PRO-like fidelity in user story environments
