So that's what Mayfly provides :)

For each user story, it provides:

- a feature branch on the application repository
- continuous integration on the feature branch
- an environment for the user story based on the feature branch
- and a verification if the user story is
  production ready, according to the Definition of Done

= Everything-as-code

- Build pipelines as code
- Environments as code
- Tests as code
- Definition of Done as code

[NOTE.speaker]

We do this by describing everything as code:

- the build pipeline is configured as code,
  we use the Jenkins JobDSL for this
- the environment is configured as code
  in a deployment descriptor file
- of course, you write tests for your code
- and we describe the Definition of Done as code

All these files are stored in the code repository,
so it is always in-sync with the code it is for.
