= Mayfly - Dockerize your user stories

*user story*-centric +
continuous delivery +
*development* platform +
using Docker

Providing each user story with:

- a feature branch
- continuous integration on that branch
- environment based on that branch
- definition of done check to decide if it's production ready

By defining everything-as-code so it can be versioned together with the code and always be in-sync:

- build pipelines as code
- environments as code
- Definition of Done as code
- tests as code
