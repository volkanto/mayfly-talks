User stories flow from the backlog to production, +
from todo to done on your agile board.

== User story

A User Story describes a single +
feature that can be tested and accepted +
in isolation, after which it can be independently +
deployed to production.


[NOTE.speaker]
--
a user story:

- can be a short-lived feature branch
- can have its own continuous integration
- can be accepted independently
- and when it's done, it should be ready for production
  or better yet, on production
