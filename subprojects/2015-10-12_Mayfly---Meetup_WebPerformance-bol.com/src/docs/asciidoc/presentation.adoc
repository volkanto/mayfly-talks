= Mayfly: feature centric development
Chris Kramer <https://twitter.com/cjhkramer[@cjhkramer]>
Software Engineer Continuous Delivery

== bol.com context
* 900 employees, more than 30 teams
* Adopted Scrum in 2009:
** 5 to 8 people per team
** 4 week Sprint Rhythm
* Over 200 deployable projects
* 3 different release models

== Growing pains...

* Shared TAXP platform
* Automated staged release train every 4 weeks
* Collectively burn down 700+ each month
* Responsible team per application
* Cross team commits
* -> code base will never be stable

Development process unsuited to support the growth of the organization

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* What's the problem that Mayfly solves?
** central test environment
** multiple teams in single codebase
** superbol
Developer velocity severely impacted by dev setup, unable to cope with dev org growth

=== The solution: Mayfly

*User Story*-centric +
continuous delivery +
*development* platform +
using virtual environments with Docker

include::userstory.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::mayfly.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::extra-storyflow.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::performance-testing.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== Current state

* Mayfly model reached maturity
* Integrating with subsystems
* Database Support for Oracle, Postgres & Mongo
* Proven company track-record:
** 28 applications are Mayfly enabled
** of which 6 are Mayfly services
** 500+ mayfly enabled UserStories

== Future

* Add more applications
* Container deployments to Production
* Run clustered production
* Design for extension
* Team-configurable monitoring & alerting
