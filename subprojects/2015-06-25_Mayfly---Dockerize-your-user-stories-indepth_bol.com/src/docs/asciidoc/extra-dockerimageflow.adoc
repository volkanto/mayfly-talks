So we use Docker as the light-weight runtime
and packaging tool. Running applications
on your local machine in the same way as
on production.

== Build && Push

The build pipeline describes how and when
the Docker image is build. This is completely
left to the project to take care off.

For easy usage we've created a Gradle plugin
that builds and pushed the Docker image for
our services. It uses a Docker image
specific to our services architecture, based
on our internal, soon to be open-sourced,
services framework "Backspin".

== Deploy

[NOTE.speaker]
--
To deploy the image, a message to Maxis
must be sent. On which Maxis takes care of
deploying it into the story environment.

== Deploy to Production

[NOTE.speaker]
--
When a story is resolved, we already have the
Docker image from the story environment.
So Grimm just sents a message to Maxis to
deploy the image from the story environment
to production.
