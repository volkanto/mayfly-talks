= Mayfly: dockerize your user stories
Maarten Dirkse <https://twitter.com/mdirkse[@mdirkse]>

== Awesome logo
image::mayfly-transparent.png[height=500]

== bol.com context

* scrum teams, 5-8 people
* 130 services & apps (SOA, the good kind)
* 2 week sprints

== Problems we had @ bol.com

* central, shared test environment
* >1 teams in single codebase (unstable `master`)
* giant release every 4 weeks

Development process unsuited to continuous delivery

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* What's the problem that Mayfly solves?
** central test environment
** multiple teams in single codebase
** superbol
Developer velocity severely impacted by dev setup, unable to cope with dev org growth
--


=== The solution: Mayfly

*user story*-centric +
continuous delivery +
*development* platform +
using Docker

include::userstory.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::mayfly.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::extra-storyflow.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::extra-rip-acc.adoc[leveloffset=+1]


== Current state

* beta-stage development
* scope limited to simple services + DB
* usage
** 5 Mayfly services +
   (eating our own dogfood)
** 12 services of other teams


== Future

* add more services
* working towards production ready
** flesh out monitoring
* better service discovery, isolation

=== Open source
