from todo to done on your agile board.

== User story

- has a short-lived feature branch
- has its own continuous integration
- can be accepted independently
- done == (ready for) production

- can be a short-lived feature branch
- can have its own continuous integration
- can be accepted independently
- and when it's done, it should be ready for production
  or better yet, on production
