== Start working on a story

* Jira -> "In progress"
* Create branch
* Create build pipeline
* Create environment (Mesos + Marathon)
* Deploy copy of `master` Docker image

== Make a change (repeat)

* Build pipeline builds change as Docker image
* New image is deployed on user story environment
* DoD checks are updated

== Resolve story

* Jira -> "Done" (if DoD passes!)
* Feature branch is merged to `master` (never any conflicts)
* Environment is cleaned up
* Last user story Docker image is deployed to production
