= `master` == production

Your users can only enjoy the new feature
if it's on production.

So we strongly believe that
for Continuous Delivery to work
`master` should be equal to production.

An integration environment does not fit in
the Continuous Delivery flow.

But Mayfly doesn't really care about production,
as long as the `master` branch is not changed
outside Mayfly.
